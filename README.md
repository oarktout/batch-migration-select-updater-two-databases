#BATCH MIGRATION SELECT UPDATER TWO DATABASE
## Principle
Migration of data based on select query executed in database Source and injected in database Destination with Table name indicated, columns are generated based on the select and data from the select too.
So the data structure in Destination database is based on the select to read from Source database.

Source corresponding where I go to search data.

Destination corresponding where I go to write data.
